cy.get('.brand').text() will not work because text() is not a cypress command
and here the explanation
if we chain a cypress command, cypress will resolve the promise and yield it to the next and will work
but if we chained with a non cypress command we have to resolve 
it manually by then() and after that we can execute the non cypress command 
cy.get('.brand').then(function(constName){
            cy.log(constName.text())
        })
